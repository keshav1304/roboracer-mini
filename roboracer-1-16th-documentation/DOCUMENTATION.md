# Week 1 — Understanding the Car

The E116 is built on a **Traxxas 1/16** chassis. This is a small all-wheel-drive car with Ackerman steering geometry. The stock Traxxas electronics (ESC, receiver) handle manual control, while an **NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano** and a **custom carrier board** sit on top to enable autonomous operation. An **Intel RealSense D435i** stereo camera provides depth + RGB perception.

## Carrer Board

This is a custom designed PCB to interface the Jetson with the power supply and the rest of the car's components.

The carrier board is a custom PCB that sits between the Jetson and the Traxxas chassis. It handles everything the Jetson can't do natively — power regulation, motor control signals, sensor routing, and status monitoring.

## Charging the batteries

The car uses two types of rechargeable batteries:

| Battery | Spec | Connector | Car Slot |
|---------|------|-----------|----------|
| **LiPo** | OVONIC 11.1V 1400mAh 3S 50C | XT60 power + 4-pin JST XH balance | Left |
| **NiMH** | Traxxas 7.2V 1200mAh 6-cell | Traxxas connector | Right |

Both batteries were measured with a multimeter in DC V mode. The readings were compared against the label values, and the LiPo was then cross-checked with a standalone battery tester — both readings matched.

| Parameter | LiPo (3S) | NiMH (6-cell) |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| Nominal voltage | 11.1V (3.7V × 3) | 7.2V (1.2V × 6) |
| Fully charged | ~12.6V (4.2V/cell) | ~8.4V (1.4V/cell) |
| Capacity | 1400mAh | 1200mAh |
| C rating | 50C → 70A max burst | — |
| Low voltage warning | ~9.9V (3.3V/cell) | — |

The C rating determines max safe discharge: 50C × 1.4A = 70A burst. The battery checker on the carrier board warns when the LiPo drops below ~3.3V/cell.

Here is how to charge both:

[![Charging Traxxas NiMH](NiMH.png)](Assets/Week1/NiMH.mp4)

[![Charging Ovonic LiPo](LiPo.png)](Assets/Week1/LiPo.mp4)

The following steps were followed to plug the battery into the car:
- **NiMH** - plug into traxxas connector to connect to drivetrain, and place in the right battery slot
- **LiPo** - plug via 4S JST balance lead to the carrier board, and place in the left battery slot 
- Close the covers and tuck all cables away from the wheels
- The battery checker on the carrier board beeped loudly and display ~11.1V before proceeding further

Some of the battery best practices we learned are:
- **Never fully drain a LiPo** — deep discharge below 3.0V/cell permanently damages the cells
- **Charge at 1C or below** — 1A for a 1400mAh pack. Faster charging degrades battery life
- **Rubber-band a battery** after it's fully charged so you can tell which ones are ready at a glance
- **Unplug all batteries** when leaving the lab — even a slow parasitic drain overnight degrades LiPo chemistry
- **Storage voltage** — if not using for an extended period, store LiPo at ~3.8V/cell (~11.4V for 3S)


## Powering on the car

The car was powered on, following these steps:
- Power jack on the carrier board was connected through a power adapter to a wall outlet
- NiMH battery was connected to its connector
- Switch on carrier board was flipped

To access the Jetson, a monitor was connected via the display port and a keyboard and mouse were connected via USB-A.

[![Video showing power on process](Poweron.png)](Assets/Week1/Power_On.mp4)

The NVIDIA splash screen appears, followed by the Ubuntu 22.04 login window. The system was logged into using known credentials. If the Jetson has not already been setup, then create an account. Connect to a local Wi-Fi network via the GUI interface that comes up on the display.

# Week 2 - Running Teleop and ROS

<!-- 
WE NEVER DID THIS OLED SETUP BECAUSE IT NEVER WORKED

## 10 · OLED Display Setup

The carrier board has a **0.92″ OLED screen** (128×32 pixels, I2C interface, Waveshare module) that displays the car's IP address and WiFi network name — essential for SSH access later.

### Setup

`startup_files.zip` was extracted to the home directory, and the files were verified to be in place:

```bash
$ cd ~
$ ls
  startupOLED.sh  startupOLED/  ...
```

The `startupOLED/` folder contains a Python script that communicates with the OLED over I2C using the `smbus` library.

### Running It

```bash
$ ./startupOLED.sh &
```

The `&` runs it in the background and prints a process ID. The OLED should now display the WiFi name and IP address.

If you see `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'smbus'`:
```bash
$ pip3 install smbus
$ ./startupOLED.sh &
```

![OLED Running](assets/images/oled_running.jpg)
<!-- OLED on the carrier board showing IP address and WiFi name -->

<!-- ### How the Shell Script Works

`startupOLED.sh` was opened in a text editor. It is a simple shell script that calls the Python program inside the `startupOLED/` folder, which initializes the I2C bus, reads the system's IP and WiFi information, and writes it to the OLED display buffer.

<!-- VIDEO: Running startupOLED.sh and seeing the IP appear on the OLED -->

## Writing a program for Teleop and running it

Using the Terminal, a new folder was created in ~/Documents for Week2 and then using vim a file called ```teleop_terminal.py``` was created.

```bash
$ cd ~/Documents
$ mkdir Week2
$ cd Week2
$ vim teleop_terminal.py
```

The code in ```teleop_terminal.py``` is as follows:

```python
# TODO
```

[[ TODO: insert code walkthrough and explanations here ]]

Running the python script and then using WASD keys to control the car (W - Forward,   A - Turn left,  S - Backward,  D - Turn right):

[![Running teleop script](Teleop.png)](Assets/Week2/Week2_telop.mp4)

If the code does not work, then double check that the ESC is blinking green. If it is not, then press the small blue button on the ESC.

## PWM Tuning

### Setting up SSH

To tune the PWM for the car, the car would have to be run on the ground and not just on the desk. Thus, there needs to be a means of controlling the vehicle remotely and not only when plugged into a display. To enable this, SSH was setup.

The Jetson was connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the laptop. Then, the following commands were run to find the IP address of the Jetson:

```bash
$ hostname -I
```

The IP address was then used to connect to the Jetson from a laptop using SSH.

```bash
$ ssh team1XX@<CAR_IP_ADDRESS>
```

SSH allows the Jetson terminal to be opened and controlled from another computer over the same Wi-Fi network, without needing to stay directly connected through a monitor, keyboard, and mouse.

### How PWM Works on the E116

The **servo PWM** port controls steering, and the **motor PWM** port controls speed through the ESC. Each car is built slightly differently, so you need to find the exact PWM parameters for your specific car.

The PWM signal runs at **200 Hz**. The duty cycle is controlled by an **unsigned 8-bit integer** (0–255), mapping to 0–100% duty. This means the minimum step size is 100/256 ≈ 0.39%.

The motor has a **deadband** in its PWM input, which is a range of duty cycles where the motor doesn't move. This prevents the car from jumping between forward and backward. There are also **transition bands** at the edges of the deadband where the motor just barely starts moving. Finding these edges is the goal of this step.

The graphs below demonstrate this concept:

![PWM for Servo](Assets/servo-pwm.png)
![PWM for Motor](Assets/motor-pwm.png)

We need to find the values of PWM duty cycle that are just at the point where the curves begin to bend, to find the minimum PWM for forward, backward, and turning left and right.   

### PWM tuning for motor

The following script, ```pwm_motor.py```, finds appropriate motor PWM values.

```python
# TODO: Insert code walkthrough and explanations here
```

The program prompts you to enter duty cycle values. You can type exact numbers (up to 2 decimal places) or use `+` and `-` for fine-tuning in 0.01 increments. For each value entered, the car runs for 0.6 seconds then stops. 

This program was run when the car is on the ground, and not on a stand, because the PWM values are heavily influenced by friction on the surface that needs to be overcome.

Before running the program, the LiPo was connected to its slot and tightly fastened in place. The AC-DC adapter, monitor, keyboard, and mouse from the car were disconnected from the car.

The value at which the motor just barely starts moving, first forward, and then backward was noted down. These values were recorded for the motor calibration and will be used later.

### PWM tuning for servo

Here, the PWM value for the servo was found that allows the car to drive perfectly straight. This is the only reference needed to enable the servo to turn to other angles accurately. Here too, the car was controlled remotely via SSH from a host laptop.

The following script was used:

```python
# TODO: Insert code walkthrough and explanations here
```

After opening `pwm_steering.py` in a text editor, the following values were updated:
  - **Line 26**: `motor_forward_start` value
  - **Line 27**: `motor_backward_start` value
  - **Line 28**: desired speed (leave at 2 initially)

Then the program was run with the car on the ground with a clear path straight ahead. Every time a new **servo_center** value was entered, the car would drive straight for a short distance and then stop. The straightness of the run was observed and the value was adjusted until the car drove straight. 

In some cases, it helped to tune Line 28 (speed) or Line 62 (duration) in `pwm_steering.py` to test at different speeds and over longer distances.

## ROS 2 Humble on the E116 Vehicle

ROS 2 Humble was installed on the Jetson in a previous step. 

Before any ROS-related project, the following commands were run once to ensure the ROS 2 underlay is sourced in every new terminal.

```bash
$ echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
$ echo "export ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

### Exploring ROS 2 with Turtlesim

Turtlesim is a simple graphical simulator that demonstrates ROS 2 concepts. You need **4 terminals** for this:

**Terminal 1** - Launched the turtlesim window:
```bash
$ ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
```

**Terminal 2** - Drove the turtle with arrow keys:
```bash
$ ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
```

**Terminal 3** - Inspected the ROS 2 graph:
```bash
$ ros2 node list          # showed active nodes
$ ros2 topic list         # showed active topics
$ ros2 node info /turtlesim
$ ros2 topic echo /turtle1/cmd_vel    # showed velocity commands in real-time
```

**Terminal 4** - Launched the ROS 2 graph visualizer:
```bash
$ rqt_graph
```

This showed how nodes connect through topics. The `/teleop_turtle` node publishes `geometry_msgs/msg/Twist` messages on `/turtle1/cmd_vel`, which the `/turtlesim` node subscribes to.

Alternatively, we can publish directly from the terminal:

```bash
$ ros2 topic pub /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist \
  "{linear: {x: 2.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 1.8}}"
```

This makes the turtle drive in a circle. The `linear.x` field controls forward speed, `angular.z` controls rotation. Negative `x` drives backward, negative `z` turns the other way.

### Building a ROS 2 Workspace with Colcon

A workspace directory was created, the ROS 2 examples were cloned, and everything was built:

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
$ cd ~/ros2_ws
$ git clone https://github.com/ros2/examples src/examples -b humble
$ colcon build --symlink-install
$ colcon test
$ source install/local_setup.bash
```

### Publisher/Subscriber Test

The minimal C++ pub/sub example was run to verify the build:

**Terminal 1** — Subscriber (waits for messages):
```bash
$ ros2 run examples_rclcpp_minimal_subscriber subscriber_member_function
```

**Terminal 2** — Publisher (sends numbered messages):
```bash
$ ros2 run examples_rclcpp_minimal_publisher publisher_member_function
```

The subscriber prints each message as it arrives, confirming the ROS 2 middleware, build system, and node communication are all working.

# Week 3 - Computer Vision and Teleop on E116

We started by creating a new ROS workspace and package.

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/team_ws/src
$ cd ~/team_ws/src
$ ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python e116
```

Other files and folders were added to the ```e116``` package to create the folder structure and files in the code under Week 3. This was double checked using the following commands:

```bash
$ cd ~/team_ws/src/e116
$ls -l
```

The output should be something like:

```bash
team100@ubuntu:~/team_ws/src/e116$ ls -l
total 44
drwxrwxr-x 2 team100 team100 4096 Mar  5 03:41 config
drwxrwxr-x 3 team100 team100 4096 Mar  5 03:46 e116
drwxrwxr-x 5 team100 team100 4096 Mar  4 18:48 launch
-rw-rw-r-- 1 team100 team100  856 Mar  4 18:48 package.xml
drwxrwxr-x 2 team100 team100 4096 Mar  4 18:48 resource
-rw-rw-r-- 1 team100 team100   77 Mar  4 18:48 setup.cfg
-rw-rw-r-- 1 team100 team100 1169 Mar  5 03:30 setup.py
drwxrwxr-x 2 team100 team100 4096 Mar  4 18:48 test
```

Then, the following commands were run to allow permissions:
```bash
$ cd ~/team_ws/src
$ chmod +x ~/team_ws/src/e116/e116/*.py              
$ chmod +x ~/team_ws/src/e116/launch/*.launch.py
```

And then, the following commands were run to clone the April Tag libraries and ROS wrapper, to enable April Tag detection:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/AprilRobotics/apriltag.git
$ git clone https://github.com/christianrauch/apriltag_ros.git
$ git clone https://github.com/christianrauch/apriltag_msgs.git
```
The file structure should look as follows:
```bash
team100@ubuntu:~/roboracer_116_lehigh/team_ws/src$  ls -l
total 28
drwxrwxr-x  7 team100 team100 4096 Mar 16 01:01 apriltag
drwxrwxr-x  4 team100 team100 4096 Mar 16 01:02 apriltag_msgs
drwxrwxr-x  6 team100 team100 4096 Mar 16 01:02 apriltag_ros
drwxrwxr-x 10 team100 team100 4096 Mar  5 03:30 e116
```

The config file in ```~/team_ws/src/e116/config/tags_36h11.yaml``` was moved to ```~/team_ws/src/apriltag_ros/cfg/```. And similarly, the launch file in ```/team_ws/src/e116/launch/rs2camera.launch.yml```  was moved to ```~/team_ws/src/apriltag_ros/launch/```.

Next, we put the tuning parameters found in Week 2 into the ROS 2 configuration files. The file ```~/team_ws/src/e116/config/e116.yaml``` was edited with the new ```motor_forward_start```, ```motor_backward_start```, and ```servo_center``` values.

The following was run to build the packages:
```bash
$ cd ~/team_ws
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y     #install any missing packages
$ colcon build
```
